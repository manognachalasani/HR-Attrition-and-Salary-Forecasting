# HR Attrition and Salary Forecasting

## üìç Overview
This project leverages the **IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset** to perform a two-stage predictive analysis for workforce management:

1. **Attrition Prediction (Classification)**  
   Predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization using models such as:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Random Forest

2. **Salary Forecasting (Regression)**  
   Estimate future salaries of employees predicted to stay, using simulated increments and regression models such as:
   - Ridge Regression  
   - Additional regression models evaluated in comparison  

3. **Expected Salary Loss (Novel Metric)**  
   Introduced a new metric that combines:
   - Attrition probability  
   - Future salary estimates  
   
   ‚ûù This quantifies the **potential financial risk** to the organization if valuable employees leave.
